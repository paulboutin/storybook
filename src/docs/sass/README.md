## Compiling

Compiling this code for use in browsers is very simple using `sass`. No specific configurations are required.

To be able to generate a corresponding bundle.css:

- Ensure `node` v.12 or later is installed with `npm` package manager.
- Run `npm i -g sass` to install webpack globally.
- Run `sass src/sass/main.scss bundles/bundle.css --style compressed --no-source-map` to compile production-ready bundle.

A precompiled version is already included in the /bundles folder of this zipfile.
