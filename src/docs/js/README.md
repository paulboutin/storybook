# JavaScript code

Full source code for all interactive components.
The code entrypoint is **main.js**.

## File structure

The code is organized as follows:

- **_components_**: Individual component code
- **_lib_**: Additional third-party code shipped to provide base functionality and browser polyfills.
- **_main.js_**: Script entry point
- **_utils.js_**: Additional helper functions and code included for use in components.

## Compiling

Compiling this code for use in browsers is very simple using `webpack-cli`.
No specific configurations are required.

You can read more about this package [here](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli/blob/master/packages/webpack-cli/README.md)

To be able to generate a corresponding main.js:

- Ensure `node` v.12 or later is installed with `npm` package manager. .icon {
  color: color('white');
  }
- Run `npm install -g webpack webpack-cli` to install webpack globally.
- Run `webpack --entry ./js/main.js -o ./path/to/output --mode production` to compile production-ready bundle.

A precompiled version is already included in the /bundles folder of this zipfile.

## Component modules

Each component module includes a default export of an executable function that targets _all_
components of the type via class name.

Individual components may be deactivated by simply removing the function call from `main.js`

- **accordion**

  Implements expand/contract logic for accordion and storytelling (mobile)

  Has an additional "toggle mode" where sibling accordions are automatically collapsed,
  and the current accordion is scrolled into view. To enable mark each accordion with

  ```html
  <div class="accordion" data-toggle-mode="true">
    ...
  </div>
  ```

  Requires cross-browser support for smooth scroll behavior (toggle mode),
  provided by `lib/smoothscroll-polyfill`

- **alert**

  Implements logic for closing accordion component via 'x' icon

- **card-carousel**

  Implements logic for article carousel component.

  Requires splide library, included as `lib/minified/splide`.

- **comparison**

  Implements logic for comparison table pagination.

- **dropdown**

  Implements logic for custom dropdown selectors.

- **help-center**

  Implements logic for help center article viewer component.

- **horizontal-accordion**

  Implements additional logic for horizontal accordion (tablet/desktop)

- **input**

  Implements logic for custom inputs.

- **navigation**

  Implements logic for navigation top bar component.

- **popup-video**

  Implements logic for popup-video components (both hero and article cards) via `lib/minified/vimeo-player`

  Can be configured via `dataset` attributes:

  ```html
  <section
    class="popup-video"
    data-popup-video-src="<vimeo source link>"
    data-click-target="<css selector for video click trigger>"
  >
    ...
  </section>
  ```

- **product-selector**

  Implements logic for product selector component.

  Includes support for swipe gestures via `lib/swiped-events`

  Requires cross-browser support for smooth scroll behavior (tabs), provided by `lib/smoothscroll-polyfill`

- **return-to-top**

  Implements logic for go up arrow component.

  Requires cross-browser support for smooth scroll behavior, provided by `lib/smoothscroll-polyfill`

- **slider**

  Implements logic for pull quote, standard carousel and closing cta carousel components.

  Includes support for swipe gestures via `lib/swiped-events`

* **third-party link**

  Implements logic for third-party popup. Detects external links via URL host matching.

  Additional safe hosts may be included in the algorithm at compile-time by providing a
  list to the function call in `main.js`:

  ```js
  thirdPartyLink({
    hosts: ['host1', 'host2']
  })
  ```

  On clicking an external link, page navigation will be interrupted, and a popup will be
  dynamically generated with a new link to the content.
