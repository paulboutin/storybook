# Pre-Rendered Components

In this folder you will find pre-rendered templates. There are 3 types:

- **\_\_base.html**: Base template which includes basic HTML setup to link bundled scripts and stylesheets.
- **\_partials.html**: Any template with one underscore prefix is a **_partial_** template.
  This only includes the html code for the component itself.
- **templates.html**: Full template with included **_\_\_base.html_** setup.
