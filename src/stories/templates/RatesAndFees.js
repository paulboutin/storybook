          <br />
          In some cases, we will not make all of the funds that you deposit by
          check available to you on the first Business Day after the day of your
          deposit. Depending on the type of check that you deposit, funds may
          not be available until the second Business Day after the day of your
          deposit. The first <b>$225</b> of your deposits, however, will be
          available on the first Business Day after the day of your deposit.
          <br />
          <br />
          If we are not going to make all of the funds from your deposit
          available on the first Business Day after the day of your deposit, we
          will notify you at the time you make your deposit. We will also tell
          you when the funds will be available. If your deposit is not made
          directly to one of our employees, or if we decide to take this action
          after you have left the premises, we will mail you the notice by the
          day after we receive your deposit. If you will need the funds from a
          deposit right away, you should ask us when the funds will be
          available.
          <br />
          <br />
          In addition, some or all of the funds you deposit by check may be
          delayed for a longer period under the following circumstances:
          <br />
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>We believe a check you deposit will not be paid.</li>
            <li>
              You deposit checks totaling more than <b>$5,525</b> on any one
              day.
            </li>
            <li>You redeposit a check that has been returned unpaid.</li>
            <li>
              You have overdrawn your Account repeatedly in the last six months.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is an emergency, such as failure of computer or
              communications equipment.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          We will notify you if we delay your ability to withdraw funds for any
          of these reasons, and we will tell you when the funds will be
          available. They will generally be available no later than the seventh
          Business Day after the day of your deposit.
          <br />
          We are under no obligation to pay any Items you have authorized
          against funds that are not yet available. The Bank may pay such items
          at our discretion and overdraw your Account or they may be returned
          due to an insufficient Available Balance. Refer to the OVERDRAWN
          ACCOUNTS AND PAYMENT OF OVERDRAFTS section of this Agreement for
          further details.

          <b>Special Rules for New Accounts (Page 25)</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          If you are a new customer, the following special rules will apply
          during the first 30 days your Account is open.
          <br />
          Funds from electronic Direct Deposits and wire transfers to your
          Account will be available on the day we receive the deposit (excluding
          the opening deposit to a certificate of deposit using our Online
          Banking). Funds from deposits of cash and the first <b>$5,525</b> of a
          day's total deposits of cashier's, certified, teller's, traveler's,
          and federal, state and local government checks will be available on
          the first Business Day after the day of your deposit if the deposit
          meets certain conditions. For example, the checks must be payable to
          you. The excess amount over <b>$5,525</b> will be available on the
          ninth Business Day after the day of your deposit. If your deposit of
          these checks (other than a U.S. Treasury check) is not made in person
          to one of our employees, the first $5,525 will not be available until
          the second Business Day after the day of your deposit. Funds from all
          other check deposits will be available on the ninth Business Day after
          the day of your deposit.

          <br />
          <br />
          If you make a deposit at one of our ATMs before 4:30 PM Pacific Time
          (PT) on a Business Day we are open, we will consider that day to be
          the day of your deposit. However, if you make the deposit after 4:30
          PM PT, or on a non-Business Day, or on a day we are not open, we will
          consider the next Business Day we are open to be the day of your
          deposit.
          <br />
          <br />
          The first <b>$225</b> of funds from any deposit (cash or checks) made
          at ATMs we own or operate will be available on the first Business Day
          after the day of your deposit, unless a longer hold applies.
